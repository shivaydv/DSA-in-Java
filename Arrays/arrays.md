# What is an Array?
An array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored at contiguous memory locations. Itâ€™s one of the most popular and simple data structures and is often used to implement other data structures. Each item in an array is indexed starting with 0 . Each element in an array is accessed through its index.

# Array Operations
Common operations performed on arrays include:

- **Traversal** : Visiting each element of an array in a specific order (e.g., sequential, reverse).
- **Insertion** : Adding a new element to an array at a specific index.
- **Deletion** : Removing an element from an array at a specific index.
- **Searching** : Finding the index of an element in an array.


# Why array index start from 0

The reason why index start from zero is that index is used as an offset. Suppose we have an array Arr = [1,2,3,4,5] Arr[0] actually means that first element is 0 element away from the memory location where the arr points as elements in an array are stored in a contiguous manner.

```java
arr = 1000
int arr[0] = arr + (0 * size) = 1000
int arr[1] = arr + (1 * size) = 1004
```

# Syntax of array

```java
int[] numbers; // Declaring an integer array

numbers = new int[5]; // Creating an array of 5 integers

numbers[0] = 10; // Setting the first element of the array

int firstElement = numbers[0]; // Accessing the first element

numbers[0] = 20; // Changing the first element to 20

int length = numbers.length; // Getting the length of the array
```

```java
int[] intArray = new int[]{ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 }; // Declaring array literal

int[] intArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // A single-dimensional array

int[][] intArray = new int[10][20]; //a 2D array or matrix

int[][][] intArray = new int[10][20][10]; //a 3D array
```

# Advantages of Java Arrays
- **Efficient Access:** Accessing an element by its index is fast and has constant time complexity, O(1).
- **Memory Management:** Arrays have fixed size, which makes memory management straightforward and predictable.
- **Data Organization:** Arrays help organize data in a structured manner, making it easier to manage related elements.

# Disadvantages of Java Arrays
- **Fixed Size:**  Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed, which can lead to memory waste if the size is overestimated or insufficient storage if underestimated.
- **Type Homogeneity:** Arrays can only store elements of the same data type, which may require additional handling for mixed types of data.
- **Insertion and Deletion:** Inserting or deleting elements, especially in the middle of an array, can be costly as it may require shifting elements.

## 1. Single Number

[Leetcode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number)

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.


#### Time Complexity - O(n^2)

```java
    public static int singleNum(int[] arr) {
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<arr.length;j++){
                if(arr[i] == arr[j] && arr[i] != -1 && i != j){
                    arr[i] = -1;
                    arr[j] = -1;
                }
            }
        if(arr[i] != -1) return arr[i];
        }
    return -1;
    }
```

#### Time Complexity - O(n)

0^num = num \
same num ^ same num =0 \


2^2^1 =1 \
3^4^5^2^4^5^3 = 2

```java
public static int singleNum(int[] arr) {
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            ans = ans^arr[i];
        }
        return ans;
